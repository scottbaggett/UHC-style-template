#UHC STYLE
This is a simple gulp app that outputs a template and a stylesheet. I referenced [this site](http://www.myuhc.info/#/mobileCode) as the base. I didn't style any of the content that would go in the main container.

This is purely the background style, typogrpahy, header & colors to be integrated into the main site build.

## INSTALL

    $  npm install
    $  gulp

## DIST
main.css and index.html are the important parts. Make sure to use the container markup exactly as it was created.
